Challange to use javascript to 
  1) Export data from javascript to an HTML table.
  2) Search for enteries based on Date/Time entries.
  3) Search for entries based on variouse tags that corresponds to the column designations
      a) was not able to select the search criteria based on list or checkbox to search each column so I created a search bar for each column so the user can provide input accordingly.
